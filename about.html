      <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>I’ve always had a passion for arts and technology and discovered that I could mold the two into a profession that was perfect for me, which is web development.  As I read more about it, the more I felt a deeper interest for this career path.  The design aspect of web development is much like storytelling and the ability to create that instant spark and charm the users in such a way to want to continue to explore more is such a captivating and powerful approach to draw in the audience.  Recently, I’ve found a new interest in photography and discovered another medium to express myself.  I enjoy exploring cities with my kids and capturing these moments through photography.  Traveling is blood in my veins and I am endlessly inspired by adventures, waking up to new horizons, and exploring the world.</p>
